Instuctions for NAN-air

1. Running the program:
To run the NAN-air booking program you find the "Program" folder. In there you will find a file and a folder. The file is main_NAN-air.py which is the main program and the folder is src which contains the program code. Then in this folder you open the terminal and enter "python main_NAN-air.py" without the " " to run it.

2. Navigating the program
When navigating the NAN-air booking program there are two types of commands to know.
General commands:
B. Go Back - Which returns you to a previous menu
M. Main Menu - Which brings you back to the User Menu and as such doesn't work when you are already there.
S. Staffer Menu - Which brings you to the Staffer Menu and as such doesn't work when you are already there.
F. Flyer Menu - Which brings you to the Flyer Menu and as such doesn't work when you are already there.
Q. Quit - Exits the program completely

These general commands work anywhere while you are navigating the program, they stop taking effect when you go into submenu's that don't have an ascii header.

Menu choices:
Each menu gives you a choice from 1 to a maximum of 9 to choose from. With each corresponding choice either leading you into different menus or allowing you to activate the programs functionality such as creating voyages, employees, etc.
Menu choices can also be strung together for faster navigation. For example, if you are at the top of the program and type in 113 then the program takes you to -> Flyer Menu -> Voyages and prints out all voyages for you. If you instead choose 121 then you would get -> Flyer Menu -> Destinations and the program prints out all destinations for you. This also works with Staffer Menu where if you are at the Main Menu and input 22 then you are moved to the Staffer Menu and a list of employees is printed out for you.

3. Program Setup
The program comes preloaded with the NAN-air destinations. But each destination is missing an emergency contact so to log those you must go to Flyer Menu -> Destinaions Menu -> Modify Destination and give each destination an emergency contact and number.

After that has been done, then you can start planning flights and creating employees, enjoy.
